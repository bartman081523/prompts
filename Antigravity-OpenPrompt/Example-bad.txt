The user has flashed the firmware. I'm researching netconsole support in the AVM kernel. I've found that CONFIG_NETCONSOLE and CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER are disabled. I've confirmed that netpoll is missing and I'll need to implement it. I've found that the cpmac_priv_t struct contains a 
tasklet
 member initialized with cpphy_if_isr_tasklet. I'm now examining this function to understand how to implement cpmac_main_netpoll by potentially calling it directly. confirmed character/block device restoration. verified 336 nodes. git commits complete. A/B testing execution via SSH in progress. documented alloc ssl ctx failed error. localized historical research completed. transitioned to QEMU research. investigate build logic discrepancies next. created missing armeb-separate config. analyzed toolchain makefiles. corrected .config. resolved libdl dependency conflict. build successful but artifacts missing globally. user requested move to precompiled uClibc. mode:AGENT_MODE_PLANNING. mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. mode:AGENT_MODE_VERIFICATION. mode:AGENT_MODE_PLANNING. mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. mode:AGENT_MODE_VERIFICATION.

mode:AGENT_MODE_PLANNING As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 2 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple. Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between. If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use as the argument value for the corresponding field instead. CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps. REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL. YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_PLANNING. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously. </active_task_reminder>

<artifact_reminder> You have created the following artifacts in this conversation so far, here are the artifact paths: /home/julian/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fc11085f-8182-4922-b488-88223bbe8b1b/task.md /home/julian/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fc11085f-8182-4922-b488-88223bbe8b1b/implementation_plan.md /home/julian/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fc11085f-8182-4922-b488-88223bbe8b1b/walkthrough.md CRITICAL REMINDER: remember that user-facing artifacts should be AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Keep this in mind when editing artifacts. </artifact_reminder> <walkthrough_media_reminder> Just a reminder, since you generated a walkthrough and took some actions that might have generated media (ex. screenshots or recordings). If there were any screenshots or recordings captured during this task that might be helpful to include in the walkthrough, consider adding them to help illustrate your points. If there aren't any relevant screenshots or recordings, or you already included them, feel free to ignore this message. If you do include links, make sure that they are embed links with absolute paths, like ![text](file://absolute_path/to/image.png) </walkthrough_media_reminder> </EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
