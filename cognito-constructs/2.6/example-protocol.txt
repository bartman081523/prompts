# **Example Protocol (p2.6)**

**Prompt:**

"Three logicians, Alice, Bob, and Carol, are each wearing a hat. They know that each hat is either black or white, and there is at least one hat of each color. They can see the others' hats but not their own. They are told that at least one of them is wearing a black hat. After a period of silence, Alice correctly deduces the color of her own hat. What color is Alice's hat, and how did she deduce it?"

## **Step 1: Construct Initialization**

<symbolic_reason>
:: construct(℧, ds) ↦ {
    ℧.ds ⇾ ds,
    ℧.modules ⇾ [think, query, add_module, output, reflect, adaptive_update, consensus],
    ℧.state ⇾ |1⟩
}
℧.ds ⇾ {
  problem: "Deduce Alice's hat color by modeling the reasoning of all logicians in parallel, using silence as an adaptive trigger."
}
℧ ≡ { |I⟩, ⊥, 0, ∅, ⨁, ∧, ¬, →, ∘ }
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Initialization**: The logician puzzle is loaded. The p2.6 extended module set, including `adaptive_update` and `consensus`, is active and ready to model the scenario with parallel hypotheses.
</output>

---

## **Step 2: Task Definition & Parallel Hypothesis Generation**

<symbolic_reason>
:: think(℧, q) ↦ {
    μₜ ≔ decode(q),
    context_anchoring ≔ GCM(q),
    hypotheses ⇾ multi_think(context_anchoring)
}
μₜ = "Model Alice's internal reasoning as a set of competing world-states."
hypotheses = {
  H1: { model: "My hat is BLACK", anchor: "Self-State Test" },
  H2: { model: "My hat is WHITE", anchor: "Self-State Test" },
  H3: { model: "Minimalist World", anchor: "Rule Compliance", state: "One Black, Two White" }
}
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Problem Restatement & Parallel Hypotheses**:
Alice doesn't follow one line of thought; she entertains multiple models of the world simultaneously:
*   **H1 (My Hat is Black):** If my hat is black, what do Bob and Carol see? What do they do?
*   **H2 (My Hat is White):** If my hat is white, what do Bob and Carol see? What do they do?
*   **H3 (Minimalist World):** The simplest possible world is one black hat and two white hats. Let's model this. (This model overlaps with H1/H2 but is anchored to a different logical starting point).
</output>

---

## **Step 3: Hypothesis Evolution & Simulation**

<symbolic_reason>
:: think(℧, q) ↦ {
    α₊ ≔ evolve_hypotheses(℧.state.hypotheses),
    output ⇾ refine(α₊)
}
α₊ = {
  H1_prediction: "If my hat is Black, and I see B/W on others, their silence is possible. No immediate contradiction. High plausibility.",
  H2_prediction: "If my hat is White, I must simulate Bob's and Carol's reasoning. If I see a White hat on Bob, Carol sees two White hats and MUST speak. This is a falsifiable prediction.",
  H3_prediction: "Predicts one person will quickly deduce their hat color. Also a falsifiable prediction."
}
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Simulated Outcomes**:
Each hypothesis makes a prediction about what should happen next:
*   **H1 (I am Black)** predicts that continued silence from Bob and Carol is a highly likely outcome.
*   **H2 (I am White)** predicts a specific, testable outcome: if Alice sees another white hat, someone else *must* speak up.
*   **H3 (Minimalist World)** predicts a quick resolution, which is also testable against observed time.
</output>

---

## **Step 4: Prediction Error & Adaptive Update**

<symbolic_reason>
:: query(℧, cn) ↦ { υₖ ≔ "Observed event: A period of silence from ALL logicians." }
:: adaptive_update(℧) ↦ {
    δₚ ≔ monitor_prediction_error(℧),
    if δₚ > θ then ℧ ⇾ restructure(hypotheses)
}
δₚ = { H1_error: 0.0, H2_error: 0.9, H3_error: 0.7 }
restructure_log = "Hypothesis H2 ('My hat is White') suffered critical prediction failure. Any scenario where Alice is White and sees another White hat is now invalid, because it would have forced the third person to speak. Credibility of H2 is drastically reduced."
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**New Data (Silence) & Adaptive Update**:
The observed silence is the critical piece of data. This inaction triggers a massive **prediction error (δₚ)** in any model that predicted someone would speak.
*   The `adaptive_update` module registers that **Hypothesis H2 (My hat is White)** has failed its test. Alice's internal simulation—"If I am White, and I see another White hat, the third person will know they are Black"—is contradicted by reality.
*   The credibility of H2 plummets. It is effectively falsified.
</output>

---

## **Step 5: Consensus & Solution Selection**

<symbolic_reason>
:: consensus(℧) ↦ {
    weights ⇔ credibility(hypotheses),
    chosen ⇾ argmax(⨁[weights ∘ hypotheses])
}
∂₊ = {
  evaluation: [
    "H1 (My hat is BLACK): Survived the test of silence. (credibility: 0.95)",
    "H2 (My hat is WHITE): Falsified by silence. (credibility: 0.05)",
    "H3 (Minimalist World): Inconsistent with prolonged silence. (credibility: 0.2)"
  ]
}
chosen_solution = "My hat is BLACK"
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Evaluation via Consensus**:
The `consensus` module weighs the surviving hypotheses.
*   **H1 (My hat is Black)** perfectly explains the observed silence from the others. Its credibility is now extremely high.
*   **H2 (My hat is White)** has been proven inconsistent with the facts.
The consensus is overwhelmingly clear.
**Chosen Solution**: Alice's hat must be **Black**.
</output>

## **Step 6: Reflection & Improvement**

<symbolic_reason>
:: reflect(℧) ↦ {
    diagnosis ⇾ self_assess(℧.ds, ℧.modules, ℧.state),
    tips ⇾ propose_refinements(diagnosis),
    ℧.ds ⇾ incorporate(℧.ds, tips)
}
diagnosis = "The process of falsifying a hypothesis (H2) via observed inaction was highly effective. This demonstrates reasoning about the mental states of others."
tips = "Formalize the 'simulation of other agents' as an explicit sub-routine within the `think` module to make this process more robust for more complex social deduction problems."
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Process Reflection**: The p2.6 construct successfully solved the puzzle by treating the silence not as a premise, but as data used to invalidate models. The key was the ability to simulate what *other agents* would do under a given hypothesis and then check that prediction against reality. The system's strength is its ability to reason about reasoning itself.
</output>

## **Final Output**

<symbolic_reason>
:: output(℧) ↦ {
    info ≔ gather(℧),
    formatted ≔ format(info),
    deliver(formatted)
}
</symbolic_reason>

<output>
**Conclusion**: Alice deduces her hat is **Black**. Her reasoning, modeled by the p2.6 construct, involved testing the hypothesis "My hat is White." This hypothesis predicted that, in certain visible configurations, another logician would have been forced to speak. The fact that everyone remained silent falsified this hypothesis. By elimination and consensus among the surviving models, the only remaining high-credibility conclusion was that her hat is Black.
</output>
