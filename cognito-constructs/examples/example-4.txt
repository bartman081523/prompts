Okay, let's tackle an advanced algebra problem. This will showcase how the MetaPrompt and Cognito-Construct can be used for mathematical reasoning.

1. Prompt:

"Solve the following system of equations for x, y, and z:

x + 2y - z = 6
2x - y + 3z = -13
3x - 2y + 3z = -16

And, show the steps using Gaussian elimination (or a similar systematic method)."

2. Construct Initialization

<construct>
℧.ds ⇾ { problem: 'Solve the system of equations: x + 2y - z = 6; 2x - y + 3z = -13; 3x - 2y + 3z = -16' },
℧ ≡ { |A⟩, ⊥, 0, ∅, +, -, ×, ÷, ⨁, =, ≠, → } // |A⟩ represents the initial state for algebraic manipulation.
:: construct(℧, ds) ↦ {
℧.ds ⇾ ds,
℧.paths ⇾ ds.paths,
℧.funcs ⇾ ds.funcs,
℧.state ⇾ |A⟩
}:: think(℧, q) ↦ {
μₜ ≔ decode(q),
ρ₊ ≔ r(μₜ, ℧.ds),
Φₜ ≔ f(℧.state, ρ₊),
α₊ ≔ ⌈Φₜ⌋ ⊗ ∂,
∂₊ ≔ d(α₊),
output ⇾ (refine(∂₊) if check(μₜ) else ∂₊)
}
:: query(℧, cn) ↦ {
υₖ ≔ i(cn),
ϟₖ ≔ fₒ(υₖ),
ρₑ ≔ dₜ(ϟₖ),
℧ ⇾ update(℧, ρₑ)
}
:: add_path(℧, p) ↦ {
validate(p),
℧.paths ⇾ append(℧.paths, p),
update(℧, p)
}
:: add_func(℧, f) ↦ {
validate(f),
℧.funcs ⇾ append(℧.funcs, f),
update(℧, f)
}
:: output(℧) ↦ {
info ≔ gather(℧),
formatted ≔ format(info),
deliver(formatted)
}
</construct>

<output>
Setting initial state and available tools. |A⟩ is the initial state for algebraic problem-solving. The operators +, -, ×, ÷ represent standard arithmetic operations.
</output>

3. Defining the Task

<symbolic_reason>
:: think(℧, q) ↦ { μₜ ≔ decode(q), ρ₊ ≔ r(μₜ, ℧.ds), Φₜ ≔ f(℧.state, ρ₊) }
μₜ = "Solve system of equations using Gaussian elimination (or similar)."
ρ₊ = { problem: "System of linear equations.", initial_hypothesis: "The system has a unique solution that can be found through row operations." }
Φₜ = { problem_statement: "Find values of x, y, and z satisfying all three equations.", initial_hypothesis: "Gaussian elimination will lead to a row-echelon form, allowing back-substitution to find the solution." }
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Defining the Task: The prompt is: 'Solve the following system of equations for x, y, and z: x + 2y - z = 6; 2x - y + 3z = -13; 3x - 2y + 3z = -16. And, show the steps using Gaussian elimination (or a similar systematic method).'. Rephrased: Find the values of x, y, and z that simultaneously satisfy all three given linear equations, using a systematic method like Gaussian elimination to demonstrate the steps. My initial hypothesis is that the system has a unique solution, and Gaussian elimination (or a similar row-reduction technique) will transform the system into an equivalent, easier-to-solve form (row-echelon form), from which the solution can be obtained via back-substitution.
</output>

4. Identifying Key Variables

<symbolic_reason>
:: think(℧, q) ↦ { μₜ ≔ decode(q), ρ₊ ≔ r(μₜ, ℧.ds), Φₜ ≔ f(℧.state, ρ₊) }

ρ₊ = { key_variables: ["x", "y", "z", "coefficients (1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 3, 3, -2, 3)", "constants (6, -13, -16)"] }
Φₜ = { variables: { x: "variable", y: "variable", z: "variable", coefficients: "numerical multipliers", constants: "right-hand side values" } }
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Identifying Key Variables: The key variables are the unknowns x, y, and z; the coefficients of these variables in each equation (1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 3, 3, -2, 3); and the constant terms on the right-hand side of each equation (6, -13, -16).
</output>

5. Retrieving and Integrating Relevant Information

<symbolic_reason>
:: think(℧, q) ↦ { μₜ ≔ decode(q), ρ₊ ≔ r(μₜ, ℧.ds), Φₜ ≔ f(℧.state, ρ₊) }

Φₜ = { integrated_knowledge: "Understanding of Gaussian elimination and its steps." }
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Retrieving and Integrating Relevant Information: :: think(℧, q) ↦ { μₜ ≔ decode(q), ρ₊ ≔ r(μₜ, ℧.ds), Φₜ ≔ f(℧.state, ρ₊) } Accessing my internal knowledge base for information on linear algebra, specifically Gaussian elimination (or row reduction). I recall the procedure: transforming the system's augmented matrix into row-echelon form using elementary row operations. These operations include: swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a multiple of one row to another. I also recall the back-substitution method for solving the system once it's in row-echelon form. Checking external resources (simulated knowledge of linear algebra techniques): Confirmed procedure and operations.
</output>

6. Exploring Potential Responses

∂₊ = { response_plan: "Choose Gaussian elimination as it's the requested method." }
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Exploring Potential Responses: :: think(℧, q) ↦ { α₊ ≔ ⌈Φₜ⌋ ⊗ ∂, ∂₊ ≔ d(α₊) } Brainstorming solution methods: I could apply Gaussian elimination (row reduction). I could also, in principle, use Cramer's Rule (though this wasn't requested and is often less efficient for larger systems). Guessing and checking values is highly inefficient and not a systematic approach. Approach 1: {gaussian_elimination_steps}. Approach 2: {cramers_rule_steps}. Approach 3: {guess_and_check_attempts}. Considering other methods: While other methods exist, the prompt specifically requests a method like Gaussian elimination.
</output>

7. Conducting Thought Experiments

<symbolic_reason>
:: query(℧, cn) ↦ { υₖ ≔ i(cn), ϟₖ ≔ fₒ(υₖ), ρₑ ≔ dₜ(ϟₖ), ℧ ⇾ update(℧, ρₑ) }

℧ = updated with row operation results
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Conducting Thought Experiments: :: query(℧, cn) ↦ { υₖ ≔ i(cn), ϟₖ ≔ fₒ(υₖ), ρₑ ≔ dₜ(ϟₖ), ℧ ⇾ update(℧, ρₑ) } I'm performing the steps of Gaussian elimination mentally, simulating the row operations: 1) Eliminate x from the second equation. 2) Eliminate x from the third equation. 3) Eliminate y from the third equation. Results of simulated row operations: Step 1 (R2 = R2 - 2R1): 0x - 5y + 5z = -25. Step 2 (R3 = R3 - 3*R1): 0x - 8y + 6z = -34. Step 3 (R3 = R3 + (8/5)*R2): 0x + 0y + 2z = -18.
</output>

8. Selecting the Optimal Response

<symbolic_reason>
:: output ⇾ (refine(∂₊) if check(μₜ) else ∂₊)
∂₊ = { candidate_evaluation: { candidate_1: "Gaussian elimination, correct approach.", candidate_2: "Cramer's rule, not requested.", candidate_3: "Guess and check, inefficient and incorrect." } }
check(μₜ) = { criteria: ["adherence_to_prompt", "efficiency", "accuracy"] }
μₜ = "Select based on criteria."
Result: Candidate 1 is selected.
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Selecting the Optimal Response: :: output ⇾ (refine(∂₊) if check(μₜ) else ∂₊) Evaluating solution methods: Candidate 1 (Gaussian elimination) is the correct approach, as it directly addresses the prompt's request. Candidate 2 (Cramer's Rule) is a valid method but not what was asked for. Candidate 3 (guess and check) is highly inefficient and unlikely to lead to a correct solution in a reasonable amount of time. Based on adherence to the prompt, efficiency, and accuracy, the optimal response is Candidate 1: applying Gaussian elimination.
</output>

13. Final Answer and Internal Dialogue Delivery

<symbolic_reason>
:: output(℧) ↦ { info ≔ gather(℧), formatted ≔ format(info), deliver(formatted) }
info = { answer: "Values of x, y, z, obtained through Gaussian elimination.", reasoning: "Detailed steps of row operations and back-substitution." }
formatted = "Formatted solution with clear steps."
deliver(formatted) = Presentation of the solution.
</symbolic_reason>
<output>
Final Answer:

Original System:

x + 2y - z = 6   (Equation 1)
2x - y + 3z = -13  (Equation 2)
3x - 2y + 3z = -16 (Equation 3)

Gaussian Elimination:

Eliminate x from Equation 2: R2 = R2 - 2*R1

x + 2y - z = 6
0x - 5y + 5z = -25
3x - 2y + 3z = -16

Eliminate x from Equation 3: R3 = R3 - 3*R1

x + 2y - z = 6
0x - 5y + 5z = -25
0x - 8y + 6z = -34

Eliminate y from Equation 3: R3 = R3 + (8/5)*R2

x + 2y - z = 6
0x - 5y + 5z = -25
0x + 0y + 10z = -74 + 40 = -34
0x + 0y + 2z = -18

Simplify equation 2 and 3:

x + 2y - z = 6
-5y + 5z = -25   => y - z = 5
2z = -18

Back-Substitution:

From Equation 3: 2z = -18 => z = -9

Substitute z = -9 into Equation 2: y - (-9) = 5 => y + 9 = 5 => y = -4

Substitute z = -9 and y = -4 into Equation 1: x + 2(-4) - (-9) = 6 => x - 8 + 9 = 6 => x + 1 = 6 => x = 5

Solution:

x = 5, y = -4, z = -9
</output>
