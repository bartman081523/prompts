The user is asking to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.
Let's denote K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). We want to find [K:Q].

First, let's simplify the field extension.
We have sqrt(18) = sqrt(9 * 2) = 3 * sqrt(2).
Since sqrt(2) is already in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and sqrt(18) = 3 * sqrt(2), then sqrt(18) is also in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
Therefore, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

Now we want to find the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.
We can use the tower law for field extensions.
Consider the tower of fields Q ⊆ Q(sqrt(2)) ⊆ Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
Then [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q].

First, let's find [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q].
The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2.
This polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 or by checking for rational roots.
The degree of the minimal polynomial is 2.
Therefore, [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2.

Next, let's find [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))].
We need to check if sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2)).
Assume sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2)). Then sqrt(3) = a + bsqrt(2) for some a, b in Q.
Squaring both sides, we get 3 = (a + bsqrt(2))^2 = a^2 + 2ab*sqrt(2) + 2b^2 = (a^2 + 2b^2) + (2ab)sqrt(2).
If ab != 0, then sqrt(2) = (3 - a^2 - 2b^2) / (2ab). This would mean sqrt(2) is in Q, which is a contradiction since sqrt(2) is irrational.
If b = 0, then sqrt(3) = a, which means sqrt(3) is in Q, a contradiction.
If a = 0, then sqrt(3) = bsqrt(2), so sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) = b, which means sqrt(3/2) = b. Squaring both sides gives 3/2 = b^2. This means sqrt(3/2) is in Q if and only if 3/2 is a square of a rational number. Let b = p/q where p, q are integers with no common factors. Then 3/2 = p^2/q^2, so 3q^2 = 2p^2. This means 2 divides 3q^2, so 2 divides q^2, so 2 divides q. Let q = 2k. Then 3(2k)^2 = 2p^2, so 3 * 4k^2 = 2p^2, so 6k^2 = p^2. This means 2 divides p^2, so 2 divides p. Thus, both p and q are divisible by 2, which contradicts the assumption that p, q have no common factors. Therefore, sqrt(3/2) is not in Q.
Thus, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)).

Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)).
Consider the polynomial x^2 - 3. This polynomial has sqrt(3) as a root.
We need to check if x^2 - 3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)).
If x^2 - 3 is reducible over Q(sqrt(2)), then it must have a root in Q(sqrt(2)).
If it has a root in Q(sqrt(2)), then sqrt(3) must be in Q(sqrt(2)), which we have shown is not true.
Therefore, x^2 - 3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)).
Thus, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) = 2.

Finally, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2 * 2 = 4.

The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 4.

Summary of steps:

    Simplify the field extension by noting sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2), so Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

    Use the tower law: [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q].

    Find [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q]. Minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, degree is 2.

    Find [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))]. Check if sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2)). Show it is not. Minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) is x^2 - 3, degree is 2.

    Multiply the degrees: 2 * 2 = 4.

We are asked to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.
Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)).
First, we simplify the field extension. We observe that sqrt(18) can be simplified as sqrt(18) = sqrt(9 * 2) = 3 * sqrt(2).
Since sqrt(2) is already in the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and sqrt(18) = 3 * sqrt(2) is a multiple of sqrt(2) by a rational number 3, sqrt(18) is also in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
Therefore, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

Now we need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, which is denoted as [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q].
We can use the tower law for field extensions. Consider the tower of fields Q ⊆ Q(sqrt(2)) ⊆ Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
By the tower law, we have:
[Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q]

First, let's find the degree [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q].
The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is p(x) = x^2 - 2.
To see this, x^2 - 2 is a monic polynomial with sqrt(2) as a root. We need to check if it is irreducible over Q. By Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2, or by checking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that x^2 - 2 is irreducible over Q.
The degree of the minimal polynomial is 2, so [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2.

Next, we need to find the degree [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))].
This is the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)).
Consider the polynomial q(x) = x^2 - 3. It is a monic polynomial with sqrt(3) as a root, and coefficients in Q(sqrt(2)) (in fact, coefficients are in Q).
We need to check if q(x) = x^2 - 3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)).
If x^2 - 3 is reducible over Q(sqrt(2)), it must have a root in Q(sqrt(2)).
Suppose sqrt(3) ∈ Q(sqrt(2)). Then sqrt(3) can be written in the form a + bsqrt(2) for some a, b ∈ Q.
Squaring both sides, we get:
3 = (a + bsqrt(2))^2 = a^2 + 2absqrt(2) + (bsqrt(2))^2 = a^2 + 2ab*sqrt(2) + 2b^2 = (a^2 + 2b^2) + (2ab)*sqrt(2).
For this equality to hold, since 1 and sqrt(2) are linearly independent over Q, we must have:
2ab = 0 and a^2 + 2b^2 = 3.
From 2ab = 0, either a = 0 or b = 0.
Case 1: a = 0. Then a^2 + 2b^2 = 2b^2 = 3, so b^2 = 3/2. This means b = ±sqrt(3/2). If b ∈ Q, then sqrt(3/2) ∈ Q, which is false because if sqrt(3/2) = p/q for integers p, q, then 3/2 = p^2/q^2, 3q^2 = 2p^2, which implies 2|3q^2 so 2|q and 2|p, contradiction to reduced fraction.
Case 2: b = 0. Then a^2 + 2b^2 = a^2 = 3, so a = ±sqrt(3). If a ∈ Q, then sqrt(3) ∈ Q, which is false.
In both cases, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, sqrt(3) ∉ Q(sqrt(2)).
Since sqrt(3) ∉ Q(sqrt(2)), the polynomial x^2 - 3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)).
Thus, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) = 2.

Finally, we can calculate the degree of the extension [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q]:
[Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2 * 2 = 4.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4
