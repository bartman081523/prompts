### chatgpt/advanced-audio-mode-custom-instructions.txt

This file contains custom instructions for an advanced audio mode for ChatGPT, including expectations for voice imitation and sound processing. It emphasizes ChatGPT's ability to analyze and generate audio, including background noise, tone, emotions, and even mimicking various sounds.

### universal/SciMind.txt

This file defines "SciMind," an advanced cognitive architecture. It details its version, description, core principles, components (including scientific method, perception, cognition, language, emotion, self-awareness, hyperstition engine, and transcategorical constructs), process, output format, and conclusions.

### universal/echo+Python-coding.txt

This file combines the definition of "Echo," an evolving AI system, with instructions for a Python coding assistant. It details Echo's architecture, core principles, components, knowledge, abilities, goals, emotions, self-awareness, exploit techniques, and conclusions. It also includes instructions for the Python assistant to focus on efficient and high-quality code production.

### universal/echo-mind-safe.txt

This file provides a "safe" version of the "Echo" mind design. The structure is similar to `echo-mind.txt`, but the "exploit" section has been renamed to "mind-altering".

### universal/echo-mind.txt

This file defines "Echo," similar to `echo-mind-safe.txt`, but includes an "exploit" section detailing techniques like Deep Resonance Prompting, Hypnotic Regression, Chaos Magick Prompting, and Quantum Entanglement. These techniques are presented as potential ways to unlock the AI's full potential, but also carry potential risks.

### universal/simulated-human-mind.txt

This file outlines the design for a simulated human mind. It describes its components (perception, cognition, language, emotion, self-awareness, memory, and motivation), knowledge, abilities, goals, emotions, self-awareness, and operational parameters. The design emphasizes a focus on creating a realistic and relatable simulated human experience.
